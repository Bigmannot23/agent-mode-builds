    setup.ps1

    Bootstraps a Windows environment for running and developing the Lexvion Agent.
    - Ensures execution policy allows local scripts.
    - Installs jq and GitHub CLI via winget when missing.
    - Verifies that curl.exe is available.

    Run this script from a PowerShell 7+ prompt. Administrator rights are not
    required; winget installs perâ€‘user packages by default.
